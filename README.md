### This skin no longer works since authlab doesn't publish job listings to its website anymore. It was fun while it lasted!
# authlab-jobs
A rainmeter skin that shows the current vacancies on authlab's [website](http://authlab.io/jobs)


#### I got tired of checking and re-checking if there were any openings on authlab so I created this skin that delivers that information to my desktop.

## Installing
Requires [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.net)

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/permafrost06/authlab-jobs/releases/latest) and run the `.rmskin` file

## Building with the python script
#### Making rainmeter skins can be a bit repetitive so I built myself a tiny python script that makes the process a bit easier for me. The script is in `meters.py`. I'm thinking of turning the script into a pre-processor of sorts. More on that in [this repository](https://github.com/permafrost06/rm-skin-builder).

Just run the `meters.py` file with python3 and it'll generate a `skin.ini` file. Note that this generated file does not have all the meters on the final version.
